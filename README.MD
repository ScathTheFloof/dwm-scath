# dwm-scath
this is my personal config

## what's included
urxvt \
picom fdev31 (configured and precompiled) \
i3lock-color \
dmenu \
slstatus \
dwm (of course) \
an installer script to make it simple and easy to install \

## note for some people
if you know the keybindings then you know that the 'modkey' is alt \
Well in my configuration it is the super key because that's what I have used for every other window manager that I have used, and I am not going to change it because I switched to using dwm. \
\
Just letting you know before you were confused as to why the hotkeys weren't working.
\
\
if you are a seasoned user who is reviewing this build of dwm for whatever reason. All you have to do is change the key definition for the "MODKEY" variable in config.h or config.def.h (whichever one that you use, I use config.h)
\

# What is this
like I said this is my personal config.
however you are free to use this if you wish. Feel free to change this configuration. Use this as a starting point for configuring dwm.
