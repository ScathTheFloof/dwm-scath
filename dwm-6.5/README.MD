# dwm-scath
this is my personal build of dwm patched and configured just how I want it.

## dependencies
urxvt (the terminal I use right now)
i3lock-color

that's about it

Urxvt is optional, you can change the terminal to whatever terminal that you use but this build of dwm also comes with a config file for urxvt. This config is a work in progress so if you don't like this config, feel free to change it. Feel free to change anything in this build of dwm, this is really on here for you to have an example configuration to work off of. Change anything on here and make it your own, it's your copy of dwm that you got for FREE because it's FREE and OPEN-SOURCE.
